# Debugging

When developing add-ins, fixing bugs, or changing Alfresco from the source code, it is helpful to debug an instance of Alfresco running on a standard

and to troubleshoot issues by stepping through the code line by line.

Here we assume you have already generated an Alfresco project using the Alfresco SDK. If you don't have a project already, follow the steps in 
[Getting started with Alfresco SDK 4.2](../../getting-started.md) to learn how to generate it in a few easy steps.
