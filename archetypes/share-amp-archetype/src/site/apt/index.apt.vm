Introduction

  The Share AMP Archetype is a sample fully featured project to manage AMP (Alfresco Module Package) projects. 
  This archetype can be used for Alfresco Share AMPs.

* Features
  
  Amongst other features, this archetype provides support for:
  
  * <<<amp>>> packaging support for your projects
  
  * AMP dependency management in Maven
  
  * Installation of AMPs in an Alfresco or Share WAR
  
   * AMP Unit Testing support. Just run the standard <<<mvn test>>> and see your <<<src/test/java>>> Alfresco unit tests run. 
  
   * Support for unit and integration testing and rapid development (using spring-loaded, see run.sh)
  
   * Seamless IDE integration with Eclipse and Idea

How to create a project:

  As of version 2.0-beta-3, you can create a project with the latest released archetype with the following command directly from Maven Central:
  
+---+
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=org.alfresco.maven.archetype: -DarchetypeCatalog=http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/archetype-catalog.xml
+---+
  
  For previous versions, you need to use the Alfresco Artifacts repository:
  
+---+
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=org.alfresco.maven.archetype: -DarchetypeCatalog=https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/groups/public/archetype-catalog.xml
+---+ 
  You should then:
  
  [[1]] Select the <<<share-amp-archetype>>> option
  
  [[2]] Specify the <<<groupId>>> and <<<artifactId>>> for the project you want to create
  
  [[3]] (<Optionally>) Select Alfresco Version / Edition (current default is: Alfresco Community 5.0.b)
  
 You can find new Share AMP project ready to go in the <<<artifactId>>> folder.

Quickstart

   Once your project is created:
   
   * Enter the project folder and run <<<./run.sh>>> (you might need to <<<chmod u+x run.sh>>> to make it executable). 
     This will setup the SDK and the Alfresco Share on port 8081 (not Alfresco Repository or Solr).  
    
   * Wait for the startup of the webapp and then go <<<http://localhost:8081/share>>>. <NOTE>: For this to work you need
   to have an Alfresco previously running on port 8080, for example as provided by the {{{../alfresco-amp-archetype/index.html}Alfresco AMP archetype}}
  
   * Import the project in your favorite IDE (with Maven integration) and start developing right away.
