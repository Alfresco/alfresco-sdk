Introduction

  The Share AMP Archetype is a sample fully featured project to manage AMP (Alfresco Module Package) projects for Alfresco Share. 
  This archetype can be used for Alfresco Share. For Alfresco Repository AMPs, please refer to the {{{../alfresco-amp-archetype/index.html}Alfresco AMP archetype}}

* Features
  
  Amongst other features, this archetype provides support for:
  
  * <<<amp>>> packaging support for your projects
  
  * AMP dependency management in Maven
  
  * Installation of AMPs in the Share WAR
  
  * AMP Unit Testing support. Just run the standard <<<mvn test>>> and see your <<<src/test/java>>> Alfresco unit tests run. 
    An sample Unit Test is provided in this archetype.
  
  * Embedded run in Tomcat and embedded H2 database for demo purposes, rapid application development and integration testing. Share runs on port 8081 by default, but you can control
    this setting with the <<<maven.tomcat.port>>> pom property.
  (<<NOTE>>: this is not a {{{http://www.alfresco.com/services/subscription/supported-platforms/} supported stack}} so use <<only for development purposes>>)

How to create a project:

  You can create the latest release archetype with the following command:
  
+---+
mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/groups/public/archetype-catalog.xml -Dfilter=org.alfresco.maven.archetype:
+---+
  
  You should then:
  
  [[1]] Select the <<<share-amp-archetype>>> option
  
  [[2]] Specify the <<<groupId>>> and <<<artifactId>>> for the project you want to create
  
  [[3]] (<Optionally>) Select Alfresco Version / Edition (current default is: Alfresco Community 5.0.b)
  
 You can find new Share AMP project ready to go in the <<<artifactId>>> folder.
