Introduction

  The Alfresco All-in-One Archetype is a multi-module project,
  leveraging Maven Alfresco SDK\x99 powerful capabilities to customize and run the full Alfresco platform embedded and all it's components.
  The archetype does not require additional download and provides a perfect starting point for full-blown Alfresco projects.

* Features
  
  Amongst other features, this archetype provides support for:
  
  * <<<amp>>> packaging support for your projects
  
  * AMP Dependency management and overlay in an Alfresco Repository or Share WAR
  
  * Embedded run in Tomcat and embedded H2 database of the full Alfresco suite, including Repository, Share, Solr
  
  * Support for unit and integration testing and rapid development (using spring-loaded, see run.sh)
  
  * Seamless IDE integration with Eclipse and Idea

How to create a project:

  As of version 2.0-beta-3, you can create a project with the latest released archetype with the following command directly from Maven Central:
  
+---+
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=org.alfresco.maven.archetype: -DarchetypeCatalog=http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/archetype-catalog.xml
+---+
  
  For previous versions, you need to use the Alfresco Artifacts repository:
  
+---+
mvn archetype:generate -Dfilter=org.alfresco.maven.archetype: -DarchetypeCatalog=https://artifacts.alfresco.com/nexus/content/groups/public/archetype-catalog.xml
+---+
  
  You should then:
  
  [[1]] Select the <<<alfresco-allinone-archetype>>> option
  
  [[2]] Specify the <<<groupId>>> and <<<artifactId>>> for the project you want to create
  
  [[3]] (<Optionally>) Select Alfresco Version / Edition (current default is: Alfresco Community 5.0.b)
  
 You can find new Alfresco All-in-One project ready to go in the <<<artifactId>>> folder.

Quickstart

   Once your project is created:
   
   * Enter the project folder and run <<<./run.sh>>> (you might need to <<<chmod u+x run.sh>>> to make it executable). This will setup the SDK and start Alfresco, Share and Solr in embedded mode.  
    
   * Wait for the startup of the webapps and then go <<<http://localhost:8080>>>.
  
   * Import the projects in your favorite IDE (with Maven integration) and start developing right away.
